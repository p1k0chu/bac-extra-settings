# bac-extra-settings
 Generates a datapack to apply settings automatically to a world running Blaze and Caves Advancement Pack, and adds extra scoreboards related to certain Blaze and Caves goals

# Extra Statistics
These scoreboard statistics are built into the datapack, if you would like only these stats but no standardized settings, download the "NO-SETTINGS" preset datapack from the releases tab

Animals: Axolotls Bred, Pandas Bred, Llamas Tamed
Chests: Ancient City Chests, Buried Treasures

All new statistics can be viewed by running the command **/trigger stats_view**

# Standard Settings
Datapack Presets Downloads (in releases) (im lazy to actually generate every preset hehe)
- NO-SETTINGS: No extra settings, only new statistics scoreboards
- SCOREBOARD: Automatically turn on advancement scoreboard
- HARDCORE: Scoreboard + Hardcore/Terralith install functions (MUST DOWNLOAD THOSE DATAPACKS SEPARATELY)
- NO-TROPHIES: Scoreboard + no trophies (how I prefer to play :])
- NO-REWARDS: Scoreboard + no advancement rewards
- CO-OP: Basic co-op settings, advancement rewards only go to first player, all players added to a the same team
If you want some combination of multiple (ie. hardcore w/ no rewards or removing scoreboard) follow the steps below to generate your own datapack

How to customize your settings:
1) Download the source code from releases and unzip
2) Change what config settings you want to change in the settings.json file
3) Run make.py (python3 is required)
4) COPY (not move or cut, in case you want to adjust settings again) the BAC-Extra folder into your world's datapack folder

scoreboard: true or false, whether to display the basic advancement scoreboard on the sidebar, becomes team scoreboard in team co-op
hardcore / terralith: true or false, runs the install functions for 
item, xp, trophy rewards: 
- "on" - reward enabled (default)
- "first" - reward only given to first player to get it
- "first_team" - first play in team (useless)
- "off" - turns off rewards

co-op: true or false, turns on co-op sharing mode
team - "none" by default, enabling a team adds all players to that team and shares advancements with the team. This is useful for showing a team advancement scoreboard on the sidebar rather than a list of individual players all with the same advancement count
VALID TEAM COLORS: aqua, black, blue, dark_aqua, dark_blue, dark_gray, dark_green, dark_purple, dark_red, gold, gray, green, light_purple, red, white, or yellow
